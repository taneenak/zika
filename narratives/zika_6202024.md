# [Introduction to the Zika virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)


In March 2015, Brazil reported a large outbreak of rash illness, soon identified as Zika virus infection and, in July 2015, found to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Zika Virus: 
- The main way the Zika virus spreads is through bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes.
- Zika infection can spread through sexual contact and from a pregnant woman to her fetus. 
- If a pregnant person gets Zika, it can cause serious birth defects for the child.
- Unfortunately, there's currently no vaccine or medication to prevent or treat Zika itself.

  # Treatment:
If you're experiencing symptoms of Zika, call your healthcare provider.  While there's no cure for Zika itself, getting plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage your symptoms.

  # Symptoms:
- Fever

- Rash

- Headache

- Joint pain

- Red eyes

- Muscle pain

This link provides a comprehensive overview of the Zika virus dataset used for the analysis, including all related views and metadata.


# [Geographic Spread](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=map&p=full)

Investigate the geographic spread of Zika virus strains across different regions. This slide focuses on the distribution patterns observed in the dataset.


# [Mutation landscape of the genome](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=entropy&p=full)

Analyze the entropy of the Zika virus genome. This slide focuses on the variability and evolutionary pressures acting on different genomic regions.


# [Side-by-Side Tree and Map View](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&p=grid)

This view presents a side-by-side comparison of the phylogenetic tree and geographic map of the Zika virus.
For this section, we turn off the entropy and choose the grid view.

Nextstrain narratives offer a way to incorporate tweets directly into your story. 

# [Thank You](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

Hopefully, by now, I have convinced you why it is important to use the narrative.


If not, I will give it another shot:

# Narrative Summary:

Nextstrain allows epidemiologists to quickly perform genomic epidemiology analyses from recent data, host those analyses online for interactive exploration, author narratives to describe the key results from their analyses, and then share these narratives with decision-makers.​


# Will be back soon:
After a short break, please join us for practice and the tutorial on how to actually make the narrative!


Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

# [Diving Deeper: Case Studies with Nextstrain Narratives](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)


We've demonstrated Nextstrain Narratives' ability to paint a comprehensive picture using phylogenetic trees, maps, static content, and animations. Now, let's explore how Narratives can zoom in on specific details through different case studies. 

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown

This section delves into how the virus
1. Affects different populations

2. Tracks its spread to specific countries

and

3. Analyze substitution rates per site per year.


These case studies showcase Narratives' versatility in allowing you to tailor your analysis to highlight a particular message for your audience.

# [Singapore](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&f_country=Singapore&p=full)
Singapore sequences form a monophyletic group suggesting a single introduction transmission that was followed by local transmission. 


# [Singapore and Thailand](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=Singapore,Thailand&p=full)
The Singapore viruses are more closely related to the Thailands. 


# [Brazil](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=Brazil,Colombia,Panama,Venezuela&p=full)
These four countries cluster together. Based on this grouping, we can see that Brazil is inferred as the location of the common ancestor. 


# [Virus Introduction to the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=USA&p=grid)

We can see the introduction of this virus in the US. If we look at the common ancestor of the viruses, we can trace the introduction date and see that it took place before 2016.

More genomic data could show us local transmission of the virus in the US. 

The current map indicates that the virus is primarily circulating in the Kansas area, with a smaller outbreak footprint compared to other regions. This suggests the outbreak might be localized.

# [Geographic spread of the virus to the US](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?animate=2015-04-20,2016-09-30,1,1,30000&d=map&f_country=USA,Dominican%20Republic&p=full)
In this slide, we see the geographical information of this transmission through time. 


# [Dominican Republic Imported Zika to the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&f_country=USA,Dominican%20Republic&p=full)

But where was the source of this transmission to the US? We see from this part of the tree that the first introduction of the virus to the US came from the Dominican Republic.

Why does it matter to know where was the source of this introduction? 

- By examining how closely related the US strains are, we can determine if a specific strain is driving the outbreak.
- Identifying the event or individuals responsible for the introduction can be crucial, especially in large gatherings where rapid spread is possible.
- Did infected individuals have contact with each other, or were there independent sources of exposure?


This knowledge empowers public health officials to implement more targeted disease control strategies.


# [Substitution Rate Per Site Per Year](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&f_country=USA&l=clock&p=full)

This shows a virus being introduced to a novel population. Now does this mean that there is a change in the mutation rate? 
Look at the slope of the US sequences, it is similar but slightly higher than the overall rate of the viral population. This suggests a higher substitution rate per site per year.
