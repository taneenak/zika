# [Introduction to the Zika virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

Zika Virus: 
- The main way the Zika virus spreads is through bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes.
- Zika can also be passed through sexual contact or from a pregnant woman to her developing baby.
- If a pregnant person gets Zika, it can cause serious birth defects for the child.
- Unfortunately, there's currently no vaccine or medication to prevent or treat Zika itself.

  # Treatment:
If you're experiencing symptoms of Zika, call your healthcare provider.  While there's no cure for Zika itself, getting plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage your symptoms.

  # Symptoms:
- Fever

- Rash

- Headache

- Joint pain

- Red eyes

- Muscle pain

# [Full Dataset Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?animate=2012-04-04,2016-11-04,0,0,30000&c=region)

This link provides a comprehensive overview of the Zika virus dataset used for the analysis, including all related views and metadata.

# [Zika Virus Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&p=full)

Explore the phylogenetic tree of Zika virus strains. This view provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among different viral samples.
Add more details, add more scientific words
In general add more detail to every slide and make sure it is telling a story on zika. 
How to read a phylo tree and what their grouping means. 
Change the zika tree part to slide 1
make sure you explain the entropy part more 
like you need to walk them through this whole process and see why things matter
why should they have the tree file?
why should they have the map file?
how are they communicating them to their partners?


# [Geographic Spread](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=map&p=full)

Investigate the geographic spread of Zika virus strains across different regions. This slide focuses on the distribution patterns observed in the dataset.

# [Side-by-Side Tree and Map View](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?c=region&d=tree,map&p=grid)

This view presents a side-by-side comparison of the phylogenetic tree and geographic map of the Zika virus.
For this section, we turn off the entropy and choose the grid view. 

# [Zika in the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?c=region&f_country=USA&l=clock)
This section highlights the Zika virus spread in the USA, featuring a clock view and regional filtering.
We filter data by Country -> USA and then choose the clock view option.

# [Entropy Analysis](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=entropy&p=full)

Analyze the entropy of the Zika virus genome. This slide focuses on the variability and evolutionary pressures acting on different genomic regions.


# [Publishable on Twitter](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?c=region&d=tree&l=radial&p=full)
Nextstrain narratives offer a way to incorporate tweets directly into your story. 

# [Thank You](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

Hopefully, by now, I have convinced you why it is important to use the narrative.


If not, I will give it another shot:


Nextstrain allows epidemiologists to quickly perform genomic epidemiology analyses from recent data, host those analyses online for interactive exploration, author narratives to describe the key results from their analyses, and then share these narratives with decision-makers.â€‹

After a short break, please join us for practice and the tutorial on how to actually make the narrative!


Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. 

# Will be back soon:
