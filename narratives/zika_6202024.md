Options: 
- Rectangular (when outgroup is known)

# [Introduction to the Zika virus](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

Zika Virus: 
- The main way the Zika virus spreads is through bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes.
- Zika can also be passed through sexual contact or from a pregnant woman to her developing baby.
- If a pregnant person gets Zika, it can cause serious birth defects for the child.
- Unfortunately, there's currently no vaccine or medication to prevent or treat Zika itself.

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
  # Treatment:
If you're experiencing symptoms of Zika, call your healthcare provider.  While there's no cure for Zika itself, getting plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage your symptoms.

  # Symptoms:
- Fever

- Rash

- Headache

- Joint pain

- Red eyes

- Muscle pain

# [Zika Virus Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&p=full)

Explore the phylogenetic tree of Zika virus strains. This view provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among different viral samples.
Add more details, add more scientific words
In general add more detail to every slide and make sure it is telling a story on zika. 
How to read a phylo tree and what their grouping means. 
Change the zika tree part to slide 1
make sure you explain the entropy part more 
like you need to walk them through this whole process and see why things matter
why should they have the tree file?
why should they have the map file?
how are they communicating them to their partners?


# [Geographic Spread](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=map&p=full)

Investigate the geographic spread of Zika virus strains across different regions. This slide focuses on the distribution patterns observed in the dataset.

# [Side-by-Side Tree and Map View](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&p=grid)

This view presents a side-by-side comparison of the phylogenetic tree and geographic map of the Zika virus.
For this section, we turn off the entropy and choose the grid view. 

# [Majority of the viruses branch from this ](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?c=gt-nuc_4716&d=tree,entropy&gmax=5254&gmin=4178&p=full)
We see that there are two clusters here. 

# [Singapore](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&f_country=Singapore&p=full)
Singapore sequences form a monophyletic group suggesting a single introduction transmission that was followed by local transmission. 


# [Singapore and Thailand](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=Singapore,Thailand&p=full)
The Singapore viruses are more closely related to the Thailands. 


# [Brazil](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=Brazil,Colombia,Panama,Venezuela&p=full)
These four countries cluster together. Based on this grouping, we can see that Brazil is inferred as the location of the common ancestor. 

# [Zika in the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,entropy&f_country=USA&l=clock&p=full)
This section highlights the Zika virus spread in the USA, featuring a clock view and regional filtering. We filter data by Country -> USA and then choose the clock view option.

This shows a virus being introduced to a novel population. Now does this mean that there is a change in the mutation rate? 
Look at the slope of the US sequences, it is similar but slightly higher than the overall rate of the viral population. This suggests a higher substitution per site per year. 


# [Zika in the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree,map&f_country=USA&p=grid)
These are the viruses in the US.
We can see that the introduction of this virus in the US. If we look at the common ancestor of the viruses, we can trace the introduction date and see that it took place before 2016.
More genomic data could show us local transmission of the virus in the US. 
We also see in on the map that the virus is circulating mainly in the Kansas area.
The circle indicates the large of the outbreak and we see that this is not as big of a circle. 

# [Dominican Republic Imported Zika to the USA](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=tree&f_country=USA,Dominican%20Republic&p=full)
This view is zoomed in on the US and its most recent common ancestor, the Dominican Republic. 

But where was the source of this transmission to the US? We see from this part of the tree that the first introduction of the virus to the US came from Dominican Republic.
We also see that we don't see any more viruses in the Dominican Republic related to this one, supporting the epidemiologic evidence that spread from this case was stopped. This strain was the last strain in the Dominican Republic: DOM/2016/BB_0058 

Why does it matter to know where was the source of this introduction? Because we can use our data to see how closely related the strains of the virus are and if one strain is spreading more than others. We can also pinpoint the event or the people that led to this outbreak. This is specifically important when an outbreak happens in large gathering social place. 
This information is useful to public health officials to better control the disease. 

The meta data could furhter help us understand the tree better since we can see if some individuals were in contact with others who were infected or if they got infected with the virus through a different source. 

# [Geographic spread of the virus to the US](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?animate=2015-04-20,2016-09-30,1,1,30000&d=map&f_country=USA,Dominican%20Republic&p=full)
In this slide, we see the geographical information of this transmission through time. 

# [Mutation landscape of the genome](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?d=entropy&p=full)

Analyze the entropy of the Zika virus genome. This slide focuses on the variability and evolutionary pressures acting on different genomic regions.


# [Importance of this Tool](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
# Limitations: 
- we are only sampling a subset of infections by analyzing sequence data, and other cases not included in our genomic analyses could have played significant roles in transmission.
- Be caustios with introduction analysis since subsampling biases affect your outcome and hence your interepretation could be changed. 

# Genomic and epidemiologic
Genomic and epidemiologic information must be considered together when interpreting findings, drawing conclusions, and implementing actions. Genomic surveillance holds promise in identifying infectious disease clusters more quickly and accurately, triggering earlier and more effective public health responses.


Do we have multiple introcutions or do we have a single introcution of the virus with on-going transmission.
This info will answer these types of questions. add this slide to the beginning so you can get your point across a bit better.
Hypothesis 1: There was a single introduction of the virus into both facilities, and there is ongoing transmission among people in those facilities.
Hypothesis 1: The genetic sequences of the virus from all the infected people would be very similar or identical.


Hypothesis 2: There were multiple introductions of the virus into the facilities, and there is ongoing transmission among people in those facilities.
Hypothesis 2: The genetic sequences of the virus from the infected people would fall into multiple distinct clusters, with the viruses within each cluster being very similar or identical.

# [Publishable on Twitter](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika?c=region&d=tree&l=radial&p=full)
Nextstrain narratives offer a way to incorporate tweets directly into your story. 

# [Thank You](https://nextstrain.org/community/taneenak/zika)

Hopefully, by now, I have convinced you why it is important to use the narrative.


If not, I will give it another shot:


Nextstrain allows epidemiologists to quickly perform genomic epidemiology analyses from recent data, host those analyses online for interactive exploration, author narratives to describe the key results from their analyses, and then share these narratives with decision-makers.​
